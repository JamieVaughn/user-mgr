/*
We want to create a dashboard interface that allows us to input a user ID 
and submit it to fetch a user object in JSON format which we can then use as data
to "hydrate" the page with user profiles in some kind of "card" style

You can choose to use either Objects or Classes to organize your code into a module

We'll use this endpoint to fetch the users: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`


the documentation for how to use that endpont is here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

Bonus: Use promises, keyframes and web-animations library to make the users "card" animated onto the page nicely and gradually
